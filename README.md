# Month of Code 

Month of Code is a one-month long self-directed free developer program to learn your favourite technology, with dedicated mentors and a space to come down and code. It is being organized by [freeCodeCamp Hyderabad](https://www.facebook.com/groups/free.code.camp.hyderabad) and powered by [Collab House](https://www.facebook.com/collabhouse). 

## Our Mission 
Month of Code is the most recent idea we have come up with to pursue our mission of building a culture of self-leanring, collaboration, learning-through-building and peer-learning in Hyderabad, India. The program is free of cost, because we're not interested in making money, but rather to improve the state of development here.
